# Fire in Dubai 

04-01-2016 07:00

A fire starts in Dubai. The fire is in a tall building. The building is close to the world's tallest **skyscraper**. The building is 302 metres tall. The fire starts before New Yearâ€™s Eve.
People can see some things. The things fall from the building.
**Fire fighters** come. They have the situation under control.
It is not clear at the moment if everybody from the building is OK.
Difficult words: **skyscraper** (a very tall building), **fire fighter** (a person who stops fires).
